 - HelloðŸ‘‹, my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdul-samad-112ba923a/" target="blank">Abdul Samad ,ðŸ˜Ž</a> and I'm a student at Brototype studying software engineering. an introvert who chose computer science so that they could work alone. But who would have guessed that I would develop a passion for programming. FlutterðŸ’»ðŸ“² is my favourite programming language, and I love solving issues. One of the areas where I gained the most knowledge was GitHub.I'm interested in the UI UX Design,  backend-development, HTML & CSS, and JavaScript. Aim to contribute to the developer community.
